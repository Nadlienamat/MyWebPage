        <p class="career-p">Since I first started studying computers, I've been more and more fascinated by the 
            huge potential of the digital world. I'm genuinely excited by the logic and creativity required to create digital solutions,
             from the way applications are developed to the way systems interact and function in the background.
        </p>

        <p class="career-p">As I learn more about this industry, I've decided that a job in software engineering, where I can combine 
            technical expertise with creativity and problem-solving skills, is what I want to pursue. What motivates me is the thought 
            of creating software that could make someone's life easier, run a business, or even address global issues. I see myself 
            writing clear, effective, valuable code that supports real-world systems, ranging from business software to mobile applications.
        </p>

        <p class="career-p">In addition to creating code, I want to work on challenging projects in collaborative environments where 
            technology and human experience meet. Even though I'm still a student, I consider this stage of learning as an essential 
            starting point for a creative and fulfilling career in technology.
        </p>

        <p class="career-p">I'm eager to follow this journey, one line of code at a time, with an attitude that focuses on constant 
            improvement and a strong interest in how digital tools impact our environment.
